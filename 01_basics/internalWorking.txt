***Python internal working:

1. Python code ---> Byte code ---> Python virtual machine

2. Byte code is mostly hidden.

3. It is mostly visible when two files are indulge in a particular task like when used import statements.

4. Compiles to byte code which is low level and platform independent.

5. Byte code runs faster

6. .pyc is compiled python (frogen binaries)

7. __pycache__ works only for imported files and not for top level files which don't includes any import statements

### Python virtual machine

1. Code loop to iterate to byte code.

2. Runtime engine

3. Also known as Python interpreter

4. Byte code is not machine code but a python specific interpretation
